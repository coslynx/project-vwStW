# Discord Bot Commands

This directory contains the following command files for the Discord moderation bot:

- `kick.js`: Implement the kick command to remove users with a warning.
- `mute.js`: Implement the mute command to silence users temporarily.
- `warn.js`: Implement the warn command to notify users about rule violations.

These commands are essential for maintaining a positive community environment and enforcing server rules effectively. Each command file is responsible for handling the respective moderation action and interacting with the Discord API as needed.
